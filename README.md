# 🏢 Coworking Space

### A Platform for Devs to Rent Workspace & Get Things Done! 💻

---

## 📌 Overview

**Coworking Space** is a sleek and modern platform concept where developers can **rent workspace** to work efficiently. This project was built as part of **Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Course** under the **Essential CSS Concepts** module.

The **main objective** of this project was to **refine my CSS skills**, particularly focusing on:

- **Positioning elements** using `absolute`, `relative`, and `fixed`.
- **Structuring layouts effectively** for real-world UI designs.
- **Mimicking a Figma design** to ensure accuracy in visual representation.

I built this project from scratch using a **Figma mockup design**, which provided an excellent opportunity to **practice implementing UI layouts** while ensuring responsiveness and structure.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Strengthen HTML & CSS skills**, particularly positioning techniques.
- **Improve UI/UX accuracy** by closely following the **Figma mockup design**.
- **Practice layout structuring** for professional-looking web pages.
